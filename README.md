# Coprime_Logic_UKA
In number theory, two integers a and b are said to be coprime if the only positive integer that divides both
of them is 1.
Write a function coprime_test_loop() that asks the user for two numbers. This function will pass those
two numbers onto a second function coprime(a,b) which will return true or false depending on whether
or not the numbers are coprime. The function coprime_test_loop() will print out a message indicating
the result. It will then ask the user for another pair of numbers and query coprime(a,b) again. It will
continue this loop until the user indicates that they wish to exit the program
